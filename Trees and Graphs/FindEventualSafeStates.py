# In a directed graph, we start at some node and every turn, walk along a directed edge of the graph.
# If we reach a node that is terminal (that is, it has no outgoing directed edges), we stop.
# Now, say our starting node is eventually safe if and only if we must eventually walk to a terminal node.
# More specifically, there exists a natural number K so that for any choice of where to walk, we must have stopped at a terminal node in less than K steps.
# Which nodes are eventually safe?  Return them as an array in sorted order.
# The directed graph has N nodes with labels 0, 1, ..., N-1, where N is the length of graph.
# The graph is given in the following form: graph[i] is a list of labels j such that (i, j) is a directed edge of the graph.

# Example:
# Input: graph = [[1,2],[2,3],[5],[0],[5],[],[]]
# Output: [2,4,5,6]
# Here is a diagram of the above graph.

# Note:
# graph will have length at most 10000.
# The number of edges in the graph will not exceed 32000.
# Each graph[i] will be a sorted list of different integers, chosen within the range [0, graph.length - 1].

# KEY STEP: Use DFS with 3 states.
# The idea is to just use plain DFS with a state = {Initial=0, InProgress=1, Completed=2 }.
# When traversing through the graph, if we detect a cycle by encountering a node which is InProgress
# if visited[node] == 1 OR by visiting a node that is already part of a cycle (node in cycle),
# these two imply that the path we have constructed/traversed so far, all the nodes in the path, are connected to a cycle, 
# so we add them to the cycle set() => cycle |= set(path)
# Finally, we remove the cycle set from the total set.
